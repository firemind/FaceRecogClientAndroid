# FaceRecogClientAndroid

**Please note: the server does not support the API the client needs anymore.**

Contains the first prototype we created as part of our term project. The client was 
built for the [face-recog-server](https://github.com/firemind/face-recog-server-python).

Was build with [Android Studio 3.0 Beta 7](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/index.html).
